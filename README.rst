**Demonstration of a passive compliant joint**
 
by Fernando L. Garcia Bermudez

v.1.0.1

Description:
 This is a simulation of a passive compliant joint set up in Blender via
 a generic 6 DoF rigid body constraint and a python script controller 
 implementing torque feedback based on the spring constant (K_theta), the
 damping constant (B_theta), and the resting position (theta_0) of the joint.
 
Usage:
 To run the simulation, press "p" when the cursor is inside the 3D view or
 select "Start Game Engine" from the Game menu.
